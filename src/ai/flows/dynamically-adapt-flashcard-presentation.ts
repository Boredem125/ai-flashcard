// This is an AI-powered flashcards system designed to help users study smarter and more interactively.
// The platform allows users to upload PDFs, PPTs, or simply enter a topic, and then uses advanced language models via the OpenRouter API to automatically generate dynamic, interactive flashcards.
// Whether it's for exam prep, concept revision, or quick reviews, the system adapts to the content and presents it in a digestible, quiz-like formatâ€”making knowledge retention both effective and enjoyable.

  prompt: `You are an AI that reorders flashcards based on user performance.

        The goal is to present the flashcards in an order that maximizes learning by focusing on areas where the user is struggling.

        If there is no user performance data, return the flashcards in their original order.

        If there is user performance data, reorder the flashcards so that the flashcards the user has answered incorrectly more often are presented earlier.

        Here are the flashcards:
        {{#each flashcards}}
        Flashcard {{@index}}:
        Front: {{{front}}}
        Back: {{{back}}}
        {{/each}}

        {{#if userPerformance}}
        Here is the user performance data:
        {{#each userPerformance}}
        Flashcard Index: {{{flashcardIndex}}}, Correct: {{{correct}}}
        {{/each}}
        {{/if}}

        Return the flashcards in the optimal order for learning.
        Output the flashcards as JSON.  Do not include any explanation or other text.

        The output should be in the form of a JSON array of flashcard objects, where each object has a front and back property.

        For example:
        [
          {
            "front": "What is the capital of France?",
            "back": "Paris"
          },
          {
            "front": "What is the highest mountain in the world?",
            "back": "Mount Everest"
          }
        ]
        `,
});
